Short answers for the below questions suffice. If you want to alter your plan for your project (and obtain approval for the same), be sure to email your section leader directly!

#### What have you done for your project so far?

I have coded the opening monologues and created a successful store that allows users to interact with the text and purchase necessary supplies.

#### What have you not done for your project yet?

I need to make random chances of negative effects occuring so that player morale will be decreased on the trip and also code out the trips

#### What problems, if any, have you encountered?

Not to many, the major one is I cannot get colorama to work and change the color of my text. Otherwise, issues that took a long time was understanding how to use tkinker and overall mapping out the project from start to finish.
